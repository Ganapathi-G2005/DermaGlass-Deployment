# DermaDetect India 🇮🇳
> *AI-Powered Dermatology Assistant for Indian Skin Tones*

**DermaDetect India** is a full-stack AI healthcare application designed to provide preliminary skin condition analysis and localized medical advice. Unlike generic classifiers, it uses an **Agentic Workflow** (`LangGraph` + `Gemini`) to act as a personalized dermatologist assistant, offering advice tailored to Indian contexts (e.g., specific home remedies, available generic medicines).

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **🔍 AI Skin Diagnosis**: Utilizes a custom fine-tuned **EfficientNet-B0** (PyTorch) model to detect 12+ common skin conditions (Acne, Eczema, Melasma, etc.) with high accuracy.
*   **🤖 Dr. Derma Agent**: A stateful conversational agent built with **LangGraph** that explains the diagnosis, suggests Indian home remedies, and answers follow-up questions.
*   **🇮🇳 India-Centric**: Trained and prompted specifically for Indian skin tones and medical availability.
*   **🛡️ Safety First**: Automatically flags low-confidence predictions (<50%) as "Unclear/Normal" and encourages professional consultation.
*   **⚡ Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React (Vite) for a premium frontend experience and FastAPI for high-performance inference.
